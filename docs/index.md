# MachineLearning101

This wiki contains my personal notes on Machine Learning. These notes serve as a reference guide for various ML concepts, algorithms, and techniques that I have learned and found useful in my journey.

Examples contain fully functional code with comments.

A good way to start would be to follow the order of the directory view on the left, while keeping the examples open on the side tab for reference.

So interact with the code, and fiddle around with the code, until it becomes second nature.
